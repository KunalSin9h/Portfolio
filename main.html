                    lthough some scientists equate humans with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member.
                    H. sapiens emerged around 300,000 years ago, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing local populations of archaic humans.
                    For most of history, all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago, saw the emergence of 
                    agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities and a number of 
                    civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 7.9 billion in July 2021
